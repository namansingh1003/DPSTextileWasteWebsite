                <p class="col-md-8 fs-4">Q: Why should I recycle used clothing and household textiles</p>
                <p class="col-md-8 fs-4">A: Clothing and household textiles currently make up 6.3 % of the waste stream or the equivalent of 81 pounds per person thrown away annually in the US. Nearly 95% of used clothing and textiles can be reused and recycled. You can help reduce the amount of clothing and textile products going into landfills by reusing or recycling these materials.

                    The used clothing industry provides lower income people around the world with affordable clothing. Clothing that is damaged, is recycled into wiping rags or ground up into fiber to create new products like, paper, yarn, insulation and carpet padding.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="col-md-8 fs-4">Q: What are some other benefits of textile reuse and recycling?</p>
                <p class="col-md-8 fs-4">A: Reduces the need to create more landfill space.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Reduces pollution created by incinerators.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Provides low cost clothing to low income households all over the world.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Recycling textiles saves the environment from tons of harsh chemicals, waste products and waste water used in the manufacturing of clothing as well.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="col-md-8 fs-4">Q: What can be recycled?</p>
                <p class="col-md-8 fs-4">A: Any clothing, household textile or commercial linen textile as long as it is DRY and has NO ODOR can be reused and recycled. Even if the item is stained, torn, overly worn or out-of-date, do not throw it away; it has a use in the clothing recycling industry. Only items that are wet (mildewed) or have been used with a solvent-type liquid (gasoline, Goof Off, etc.) cannot be recycled.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="col-md-8 fs-4">Q: How are textiles recycled?</p>
                <p class="col-md-8 fs-4">A: Nearly 100% of all used clothing and household textiles can be re-used or recycled: 45% are re-used as apparel; 30% are converted into industrial polishing/wiping cloths and 20% are processed into fiber to be manufactured into new products. 95% of all used clothing is recyclable, only 5% is unusable due to mildew or other contamination.

                    Companies in the textile reuse and recycling industry consist of collectors, processors and distributors of all types of used clothing, textiles and secondary materials.
                    
                    Collectors are companies that collect used clothing and other household textiles from the public. In addition, recycled textile collectors gather materials from industrial laundries, healthcare institutions, hotels, and other businesses that utilize large amounts of textile products. Another source of textile products that is directed into the recycling stream by "collector" companies is textile waste from clothing manufacturers.
                    
                    Collectors bale and sell these clothing products "as is" to clothing graders or other dealers. Used clothing "graders" sort the items assign a "grade" and re-sell the graded product. The activities of collectors, graders, and used clothing brokers are instrumental in diverting solid waste from landfills.
                    
                    Processors sort, grade and reprocess used clothing and household textiles during the recycling process. At the facilities where the collected clothing and textiles are sorted, the items are then made into large bales to be re-sold. The newly created bales of used clothing may be re-sold within the United States, although most often the products are shipped overseas to developing markets in Asia, Africa, Europe, or Central and South America.
                    
                    Textile processors also collect items from industrial laundries that are deemed to be unfit to be used by the laundry's clients. These items are sorted and bleached to make them more absorbent before they are cut into wiping cloths.
                    
                    Some companies re-process used clothing back into their original fiber. These companies create blends of fiber that are sold in bales to companies that re-manufacture the fiber content into new products. These products include: home insulation (made from the denim of reprocessed blue jeans), stuffing for furniture, athletic equipment, pet bedding, automotive soundproofing, and carpet padding among many other new products.
                    
                    Distributors take the used clothing or textiles that are cut or converted into wiping products and then sold to industrial, manufacturing, retail, and other end-use clients. Broker companies fall within the distributor category as well.  These businesses facilitate the transactions between collector companies, grader companies and buyers. Materials that are brokered within the used clothing industry include institutional mixed used clothing, clothing gathered by collector companies and materials that have been sorted by grader companies. The clients of brokers are often foreign businesses located in Africa, Asia, Europe, or South America. On occasion, brokers also facilitate transactions among companies within the United States, depending on the needs of their client companies.</p>

                <p class="col-md-8 fs-4">Q: Where can you recycle your textiles?</p>
                <p class="col-md-8 fs-4">A: Look for clothing collection boxes in your neighborhood.  SMART members must follow the SMART Collection Bin Code of Conduct
                    Check with your favorite local charity or thrift store about collection locations to see where you can drop-off your textiles. The local Goodwill, Salvation Army, St. Vincent DePaul, Savers or other Thrift Stores will recycle any textile that is not sellable in their stores.
                    Ask your town or city if they have a textile recycling program.
                    Call or visit the website of your local transfer station or town landfill or dump to see if they have collection boxes.
                    Check your mail for charities that offer curb side pick-up of clothing and textiles.</p>
